# Editing _Normal_ and _Floating_ Bookmarks

> **Librera** supports two types of bookmarks: _normal_ and _floating_. The user is allowed to change their text and page number

__Normal__ bookmarks always refer to the same page numbers in a book

__Floating__ bookmarks refer to _dynamic_ pages

> You can edit bookmarks, i.e., change their text and style. To enter the edit mode, just long-press on a bookmark in the **Bookmarks** window.

If you need to change the page number for a **normal** bookmark:
- convert it to a _floating_ bookmark
- point it to a new destination
- convert it back to _normal_
