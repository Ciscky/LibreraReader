# Annotating and Drawing in PDF Files

> _Librera_ supports basic annotation and drawing markup tools in PDF. **These tools work only in SCROLL Mode**

To make a PDF document suitable for drawing and/or annotating, the user should switch to Scroll Mode.  
This will reveal the _Edit_ icon on the bottom menu.

## PDF Files without a Text Layer
- Handwritten notes
- Freehand drawings (a stylus is highly recommended)
- Blotting out text, pictures, credit card info, etc.
> Tip: Lock the "lock" in bottom right corner to prevent lateral movements!
