<br>
<br><!-- audio --> The next day, just before noon.
<br>
<br>Before me was a huge multi story apartment that looking up at the roof would be tiring.
<br>
<br>Greeting the guard that I’m acquaintance with more than just a face recognition, I told the manager my business and
have them contact Rin-chan
<br>
<br>With overprotective parents, The mansion that Rin-chan lives in, is dozens of hundreds of meters above ground.
<br>
<br>There are about 40 floors but one floor of it was bought just for Rin-chan.
<br>
<br>I know that it’s to guarantee her safety but, I heard that most of the rooms aren’t in use, it makes me wanna say
that I don’t really know what rich people think.
<br>
<br>While being hit with a feeling of being out-of-place, I used the elevator and arrived at the 40th floor above
ground.
<br>
<br>Pushing the fancy intercom, instead of a reply, there was a sound of a door opening.
<br>
<br>「Welcome, I was waiting for you」
<br>
<br>「Yeah, thanks for the welcome」
<br>
<br>Consenting to Rin-chan’s ushering, I welcome myself in her house.
<br>
<br>It has been a long time since I have come here. I think that the last time I came here was just before when Rin-chan
graduated from high school, so about 3 years.
<br>
<br>「aaah…..for the first in years, it is time to replenish my Nana vitamins…. 」
<br>
<br>「Uwaabu-」
<br>
<br>Me who was moving towards the living room, from behind me, I was hugged by Rin-chan strongly that there was a sound.
<br>
<br>Rin-chan has a very glamorous wagamama(curvy) body, and moreover she is a woman on the taller side of a height up
until 170cm.
<br>
<br>To me who is about 155cm, If i were hugged then it would look like my face is wrapped up by her soft breasts(Oppai).
(9: oppai)
<br>
<br>While feeling the softness that I could never experience with my petite breasts, I let her continue her deed.
<br>
<br>「Rin-chan, I can’t move」
<br>
<br>「Just a bit more…just a bit more…」
<br>
<br>She continued clinging on me for 5 minutes.
<br>
<br>「It’s been a year since we’ve met again. Though the time where we could take our time, was since high school
graduation was it?」
<br>
<br>「Well, I was swamped with part time job in that 1 year after all」
<br>
<br>「Even if I invite you, there’s a part time job, and when I invite again there’s another part time job. Think about
my feelings who kept being rejected」
<br>
<br>「Ahaha……」
<br>
<br>While taking a meal that seemed prepared for my liking, I had a bitter smile as I avoided her blunt statement.
<br>
<br>Honestly, there’s a part of my life that I had to part time jobs to live.
<br>
<br>Certainly I have to work so that I can live.
<br>
<br>But, at most, working for 5 night shifts a week was enough funds to live alone.
<br>
<br>I particularly mostly don’t have any greed so, I pretty much have a lot saved up.
<br>
<br>But still I am working because I’m just an earnest person without any hobbies, no other reason than that.
<br>
<br>I have no greed because I have no hobbies, I have no hobbies because I have no greed.
<br>
<br>When I have a day where I have nothing to do, I won’t do anything but live aimlessly.
<br>
<br>Since I felt that it’s such a waste, I worked all the time just to kill the time where I do nothing at all.
<br>
<br>「Well, fine. Since we have met each for such a long time after all」
<br>
<br>Rin-chan put off her frowning face into a smile, and I was also relieved.
<br>
<br>「Though I have to search for a job once again」
<br>
<br>While drinking tea after eating, I grumble those words.
<br>
<br>That’s right, Me who had become a NEET needs to search for a job once again.
<br>
<br>「About that, there is no problem」
<br>
<br>「Eh? why?」
<br>
<br>「Though I planned to talk about it during last night’s call」
<br>
<br>Rin-chan cut off the depressing feeling of job hunting with a prideful face, I unintentionally opened my eyes wide.
<br>
<br>Now that I think about it, yesterday, Rin-chan called me because she has some business with me.
<br>
<br>I remember she put it off after hearing my circumstances.
<br>
<br>「Nana, do you remember my current Job?」
<br>
<br>「Let’s see, If I’m not wrong, game contests, something like those」
<br>
<br>「E-sports. Well it’s not only that though, what’s correct is I am a pro gamer. Tentatively I belong to a
corporation」
<br>
<br>「With the Takajou Group?」
<br>
<br>「Well yeah」
<br>
<br>Rin-chan nodded as if it was natural, I reflexively laughed.
<br>
<br>It’s the Takajou Group that even has a pro baseball team.
<br>
<br>Having a gaming version of that is totally not a strange thing, as always it’s sure is a corporation that works on
many industries.
<br>
<br>Rin-chan being a pro gamer, and If I remember it correctly she also does live streaming.
<br>
<br>On that platform she is quite a famous player, even without her connections she is an owner of a great ability.
<br>
<br>We have known each other for a long time but, since Rin-chan was young she was totally in love with games, In class
she was always number one in games.
<br>
<br>I love Rin-chan who enjoys games, so we both do it together, looking back I remember those times.
<br>
<br>「Nana, do you know about《WorldLive-ONLINE》?」
<br>
<br>「Worldlive….aah. Some of the kids at work might have talked about it. It’s that right, that virtual game?」
<br>
<br>「That’s right. It’s an online game that just started 10 days ago. It’s the hot topic in Japan’s VR industry」
<br>
<br>《Worldlive-ONLINE》
<br>
<br>It is something that was made with an extraordinary amount of money, a really outstanding online game.
<br>
<br>I have a junior at my part time job that is attached to me, a boy. He put a lot of emphasis on that game but that’s
all I understand about it. (9: don’t worry about the boy)
<br>
<br>「Well, Nana won’t know the amazing parts of this game even If I told you so, if I were to summarize it.
《WorldLive-ONLINE》is you see, a full dive game but at the same time it’s a game where you can live stream」
<br>
<br>「I don’t really get it but, was there no other games that could do it?」
<br>
<br>「That’s right. The game on itself is on another generation but, it can’t be helped for Nana who have no idea about
VR games」
<br>
<br>Full dive. That is a function where your consciousness is brought into a virtual world.
<br>
<br>It has been many years since it was announced but, during the early days Rin-chan let me experience it.
<br>
<br>At that time I couldn’t move really well but, right now I heard that you could freely move.
<br>
<br>It seems that the full dive game wasn’t able to do live streams.
<br>
<br>In this world there aren’t only VR Games.
<br>
<br>A game where you could live stream is the mainstream in this current period, I could imagine that VR games are not
suited for earning money.
<br>
<br>And then 《WorldLive-Online》, was the game that turned that around.
<br>
<br>「I’m guessing that you get it now. That’s right, since 10 days ago I have started this game. As a pro gamer, I can’t
be late with the current wave after all」
<br>
<br>「I see. So, why did you bring that topic up to me?」
<br>
<br>「It seems like you’re dense on that part. Well, If I went round about It might not be able to reach you so. I’ll say
it straight…..Nana, let’s play the Game together」
<br>
<br>Those words seem light but at the same time serious.
<br>
<br>Rin-chan gave me a bit of an upward glance, facing towards me with pleading eyes.
<br>
<br>We have known each other for a long time but, when Rin-chan asks like this, Her heart is really anxious that it
seems like it would get smashed.
<br>
<br>She is not asking for a favor. it’s not an invitation. If i were to say the word for I guess it’s 「pleading」.
<br>
<br>And then I am really weak against Rin-chan like this.
<br>
<br>「Yeah, it’s fine. For the first time in a long time, let’s play the game together」
<br>
<br>「Really?」
<br>
<br>「What would a lie do for me?」
<br>
<br>「You’re right. That’s great, I thought you would refuse it, I was really worried you know」
<br>
<br>「Well, if I had a part time job then I might refused but….there aren’t any right now」
<br>
<br>The great timing that she said yesterday must’ve been about this.
<br>
<br>Certainly if my workplace didn’t go bankrupt then there would be a chance that I might have refused.
<br>
<br>But still, I couldn’t imagine Rin-chan not expecting that.
<br>
<br>Most likely, so that I would agree there are various things she didn’t explain yet.
<br>
<br>Looking at Rin-chan who had a relieved face, returning to reality she now had a serious face.
<br>
<br>「I am a pro gamer, and also a live streamer. It’s not like I am always live streaming but, Now that you’re going to
be playing with me, there would be many opportunities that Nana would come out during live streaming 」
<br>
<br>「Well, obviously」
<br>
<br>If I were to play with a live streamer, I’m sure that these opportunities would increase.
<br>
<br>I don’t really mind it myself but, I don’t really know about the viewers though.
<br>
<br>「So, I was thinking various ways but….Nana, why don’t try being a pro gamer?」
<br>
<br>「…..yes?」
<br>
<br>Rin-chan who thought up about that proposal, it was something totally outside of my expectation.
